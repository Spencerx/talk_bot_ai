## Nextcloud Talk Bot

Demonstration of using [AppAPI](https://github.com/cloud-py-api/app_api) and Talk Bot API.

The bot is capable of stupidly answering questions in chat.

This application is an example, the language model used in it is microscopic, which is ideal for an example.

It shouldn't be too difficult to use a more advanced model based on this example and release a full-fledged application.

Refer to [How to install](https://github.com/cloud-py-api/talk_bot_ai_example/blob/main/HOW_TO_INSTALL.md) to try it.
